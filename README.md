# Minecraft Item Image Export

A simple utility mod I made to export item icons for my [ME Web Interface](https://github.com/SchachSebastian/me-web-interface) project.

### How to use

1. Run the command: `/gen-item-images`
2. Your images will be saved in a folder named `item-images` inside your main Minecraft directory.
